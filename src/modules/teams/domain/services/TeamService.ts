/**
 * TeamService - Main orchestration service for team management (Refactored with SOLID)
 *
 * Orchestrates team operations by delegating to specialized services.
 * Follows SOLID principles with dependency injection and single responsibility.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Delegates member management to TeamMemberService (SRP)
 * - Delegates validation to TeamValidationService (SRP)
 * - Depends on interfaces, not concrete implementations (DIP)
 * - Extensible through service swapping (OCP)
 *
 * SOLID Principles Applied:
 * - SRP: Orchestration only, delegates to specialized services
 * - DIP: Depends on ITeamMemberService, ITeamValidationService, ITeamEventPublisher interfaces
 * - OCP: Can extend with new services without modifying this class
 * - LSP: Any implementation of interfaces can be substituted
 * - ISP: Interfaces are focused and single-purpose
 *
 * Features:
 * - Team creation with captain assignment
 * - Member join/leave operations
 * - Captain-only team updates
 * - Maximum member capacity enforcement
 * - Event publication for integration
 *
 * @example
 * // With dependency injection (testable)
 * const service = new TeamService(mockMemberService, mockValidationService, mockEventPublisher);
 *
 * // With default implementations (production)
 * const service = new TeamService();
